    <p>Many people come to me with questions about their health in relation to fitness and nutrition. Most of the time they dont like my answers.</p>
    <p>Thats because my answers are honest and usually involve the message that they dont get off their butts enough.</p>
    <p>Our society has evolved faster than our bodies. People can now look for the easy way to do just about everything, with little need for physical activity anymore.
        Physical activity has become too difficult because we have become to comfortable in our everyday lives. Then we complain about our obesity, CVD and diabetes. Yet are too comfortable to do anything about it. I speak from experience when I say that you need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Nobody ever acomplished anything by doing nothing.
